| **Antipattern**            | **Description**                                                                           |

| Busy Database          | Offloading too much processing to a data store.                                       |
| Busy Front End         | Moving resource-intensive tasks onto background threads.                              |
| Chatty I/O             | Continually sending many small network requests.                                      |
| Extraneous Fetching    | Retrieving more data than is needed, resulting in unnecessary I/O.                    |
| Improper Instantiation | Repeatedly creating and destroying objects that are designed to be shared and reused. |
| Monolithic Persistence | Using the same data store for data with very different usage patterns.                |
| No Caching             | Failing to cache data.                                                                |
| Noisy Neighbor         | A single tenant uses a disproportionate amount of the resources.                      |
| Retry Storm            | Retrying failed requests to a server too often.                                       |
| Synchronous I/O        | Blocking the calling thread while I/O completes.                                      |
