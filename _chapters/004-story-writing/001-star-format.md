* Situation: Set the scene and give the necessary details of your example.
* Task: Describe what your responsibility was in that situation.
* Action: Explain exactly what steps you took to address it.
* Result: Share what outcomes your actions achieved.

**Share a story about an occasion when you were forced to compromise**

while i was working in amazon we had faced this scenario, where in we were trying to push all our boundaries to deliver multiple features, however it just seemed impossible within the given time frame. like multiple locations of device and geolocation based behaviour

 so, We had two options - either cut some important features to meet the deadline or extend the timeline and risk disappointing stakeholders. As the project lead, I knew I had to find a solution that ensured the satisfaction of both the team and our stakeholders.

After discussing the situation with the team, we brainstormed alternatives and came up with a compromise. We decided to prioritize the core features and delay the implementation of the less critical ones. This compromise allowed us to meet the deadline while still delivering a product that met the basic requirements.

To ensure transparency, I communicated the compromise to our stakeholders. I explained the challenges we encountered, our decision-making process, and the benefits of this compromise. By involving them in the process and being open about our limitations, we managed to maintain their trust and understanding.

Implementing this compromise was not easy, but by constantly communicating with the team and stakeholders, we navigated the situation successfully. This experience taught me the importance of flexibility, collaboration, and effective communication when faced with difficult decisions and tight deadlines.


**Can you tell me about a time when you made a decision that didn't work out? What did you learn as a result of this?**

While at amazon i had been working on webRtc optimisation for reducing the time in receiving the first frame, and reduce the dropping of messages.
 Unfortunately, I made a rushed decision without thoroughly evaluating all the available options. As a result, the software we implemented turned out to be inadequate for our specific needs. Due to this mistake, I learned the importance of conducting thorough research and engaging relevant stakeholders in the decision-making process. I now understand the significance of considering multiple options, gathering feedback, and ensuring that any decision aligns with the goals and requirements of the organization. This experience has taught me to approach decision-making with more careful deliberation and attention to detail, ensuring the selection of the most suitable solution for the intended purpose.

**Discuss a conflict you had with your manager.**

Let me pick this example from while i was working with zeta, i was working on refractoring our dashboards, 
wherein I had encountered a conflict with my manager regarding a project deadline. 

I believed that the timeline set for completion was unrealistic and would compromise the quality of our work. Rather than simply expressing my disagreement, I took the initiative to schedule a meeting with my manager to discuss my concerns in a respectful and professional manner. During the meeting, I explained my reasons for believing that an extension was necessary in order to ensure a successful outcome for the project. I supported my arguments with data and examples to help my manager understand the potential risks involved. Additionally, I proposed alternative solutions and offered to take on additional responsibilities to help meet the revised deadline if necessary. 

By approaching the situation with clear communication and a proactive mindset, I was able to find common ground with my manager and we ultimately agreed on a more realistic timeline that allowed us to deliver high-quality work. Through this experience, I learned the importance of effective communication and problem-solving techniques in resolving conflicts within a professional setting.

**Tell me about a time when you mentored someone**

I had the opportunity to mentor a junior intern who was struggling with a complex project. Recognizing his potential, I scheduled regular one-on-one meetings to understand his challenges and provide guidance. By breaking down the project into smaller tasks, setting clear milestones, and offering technical assistance, I helped him regain confidence and develop a more structured approach. Through constructive feedback and sharing best practices, he quickly grasped the intricacies of the project and showcased remarkable progress. and witnessing his growth was immensely rewarding, as he eventually completed the project successfully and even exceeded expectations. This experience affirmed my belief in the power of mentorship and cemented my passion for guiding others towards success in their professional journey.
