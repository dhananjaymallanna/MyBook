The STAR method is an interview technique that gives you a straightforward format you can use to tell a story by laying out the Situation, Task, Action, and Result.

* Situation: Set the scene and give the necessary details of your example.
* Task: Describe what your responsibility was in that situation.
* Action: Explain exactly what steps you took to address it.
* Result: Share what outcomes your actions achieved.
